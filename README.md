# Game Shop Quarkus

This application was used for learning purposes, keep in mind that the code does not reflect any functionality and its main reason is be a POC.

It uses Hibernate with Panache, for more information on how it works please visit Quarkus website.

2 endpoints were used to test and see in action the simplicity of REST services using RestEasy along with Quarkus.

## ToDo

Create the deploys for Kubernetes
